Taking a CMS with a left side and right side frames UI setup, these Javascript functions will allow you to replace the two frames with two containers such as div's with ID's CmsLeftSide and CmsRightSide. 

HTTP requests that occur in your existing scripts will be handled to put the result the appropriate container, similar to how the frames UI performed.
